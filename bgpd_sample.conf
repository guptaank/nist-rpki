! Below we have route maps to control what prefix gets announced from
! each mux.  This is very tightly coupled with how the ctrlpfx.py
! controls announcements.  Changes here will require changes to the
! ctrlpfx.py script (and vice-versa).  Each prefix should be controlled
! at its corresponding permit number.  E.g., if you want to announce
! 184.164.243.0/24 from Clemson, change route-map CLEMSON permit 243.
